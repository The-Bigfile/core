This repo contains the Sia consensus and p2p packages, along with foundational
types and functions. It does *not* contain many key components of a runnable
node, such as a blockchain manager, transaction pool, wallet, or gossip server;
for those, see [coreutils](https://github.com/The-Bigfile/coreutils).
